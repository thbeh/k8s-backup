# Building Strimzi

Strimzi is using `make` as its main build system. Our make build supports 
several different targets mainly for building and pushing Docker images.

The build also uses an Java annotation processor. Some IDEs (such as IntelliJ) doesn't, by default, run the annotation processor in their build process. You can run `mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs` to run the annotation processor as the maven build and the IDE should then be able to use the generated classes. It is also possible to configure the IDE to run the annotation processor itself.

## Docker images

### Building Docker images

The `docker_build` target will build the Docker images provided by the 
Strimzi project. You can build all Strimzi Docker images by calling 
`make docker_build` from the root of the Strimzi repository. Or you can build 
an individual Docker image by running `make docker_build` from the 
subdirectories with their respective Dockerfiles - e.g. `kafka_base`, 
`kafka` etc.

The `docker_build` target will always build the images under the 
`strimzi` organization. This is necessary in order to be able to reuse 
the base image you might have just built without modifying all Dockerfiles. 
The `DOCKER_TAG` environment variable configures the Docker tag 
to use (default is `latest`).

### Tagging and pushing Docker images

Target `docker_tag` can be used to tag the Docker images built by the 
`docker_build` target. This target is automatically called by the `docker_push` 
target and doesn't have to be called separately. 

To configure the `docker_tag` and `docker_push` targets you can set following 
environment variables:
* `DOCKER_ORG` configures the Docker organization for tagging/pushing the 
  images (defaults to the value of the `$USER` environment variable)
* `DOCKER_TAG` configured Docker tag (default is `latest`)
* `DOCKER_REGISTRY` configures the Docker registry where the image will 
  be pushed (default is `docker.io`)

## Building everything

`make all` command can be used to triger all the tasks above - build the 
Docker images, tag them and push them to the configured repository.

`make` invokes Maven for packaging Java based applications (that is, Cluster Operator, Topic Operator, ...). 
The `mvn` command can be customized by setting the `MVN_ARGS` environment variable when launching `make all`. 
For example, `MVN_ARGS=-DskipTests make all` can be used to avoid running the unit tests.

## Pushing images to the cluster's Docker repo

When developing locally you might want to push the docker images to the docker
repository running in your local OpenShift cluster. This can be quicker than
pushing to dockerhub and works even without a network connection.

Assuming your OpenShift login is `developer` and project is `myproject` 
you can push the images to OpenShift's Docker repo like this:

1. Make sure your cluster is running,

        oc cluster up

   By default, you should be logged in as `developer` (you can check this 
   with `oc whoami`)
        
2. Log in to the Docker repo running in the local cluster:

        docker login -u developer -p `oc whoami -t` 172.30.1.1:5000
        
   `172.30.1.1:5000` happens to be the IP and port of the Docker registry
   running in the cluster (see `oc get svc -n default`). Note that we are using the `developer` OpenShift user and the 
   token for the current (`developer`) login as the password. 
        
3. Now run `make` to push the development images to that Docker repo:

        DOCKER_REGISTRY=172.30.1.1:5000 DOCKER_ORG=`oc project -q` make all
        
4. In order to use the built images, you need to update the `image` field in the `examples/install/cluster-operator/07-deployment.yml` with the new value `172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/cluster-operator:latest` related to the Cluster Operator and all the defaul images used for Kafka, Zookeeper, Topic Operator and so on. Following the main fields you have to update:

```yaml
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_ZOOKEEPER_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/zookeeper:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/kafka:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/kafka-connect:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_S2I_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/kafka-connect-s2i:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TOPIC_OPERATOR_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/topic-operator:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_INIT_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/kafka-init:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TLS_SIDECAR_ZOOKEEPER_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/zookeeper-stunnel:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TLS_SIDECAR_KAFKA_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/kafka-stunnel:latest
- name: STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TLS_SIDECAR_TOPIC_OPERATOR_IMAGE
  value: 172.30.1.1:5000/myproject/topic-operator-stunnel:latest
```

5. Then you can deploy the Cluster Operator running:

    oc create -f examples/install/cluster-operator

6. Finally, you can deploy the cluster ConfigMap running:

    oc create -f examples/configmaps/cluster-operator/kafka-ephemeral.yaml

## Release

`make release` target can be used to create a release. Environment variable 
`RELEASE_VERSION` (default value `latest`) can be used to define the release 
version. The `release` target will:
* Update all tags of Docker images to `RELEASE_VERSION`
* Update documentation version to `RELEASE_VERSION`
* Set version of the main Maven projects (`topic-operator` and `clutser-operator`) to `RELEASE_VERSION` 
* Create TAR.GZ and ZIP archives with the Kubernetes and OpenShift YAML files which can be used for deployment
and documentation in HTML format.
 
The `release` target will not build the Docker images - they should be built and pushed automatically by Travis CI 
when the release is tagged in the GitHub repository. It also doesn't deploy the Java artifacts anywhere. They are only 
used to create the Docker images.

The release process should normally look like this:
1. Create a release branch
2. Export the desired version into the environment variable `RELEASE_VERSION`
3. Run `make release`
4. Commit the changes to the existing files (do not add the TAR.GZ and ZIP archives into Git)
5. Push the changes to the release branch on GitHub
6. Create the tag and push it to GitHub. Tag name determines the tag of the resulting Docker images. Therefore the Git 
tag name has to be the same as the `RELEASE_VERSION`,
7. Once the CI build for the tag is finished and the Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub, Create a GitHub release and tag based on the release branch. 
Attach the TAR.GZ and ZIP archives to the release
8. On the `master` git branch, update the versions to the next SNAPSHOT version using the `next_version` `make` target. 
For example to update the next version to `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT` run: `make NEXT_VERSION=0.6.0-SNAPSHOT next_version`.

## Running system tests

### Test groups

To execute an expected group of system tests need to add system property `junitgroup` with following value:

`-Djunitgroup=integration` - to execute one test group
`-Djunitgroup=acceptance,regression` - to execute many test groups
`-Djunitgroup=all` - to execute all test groups

If `junitgroup` system property isn't defined, all tests without an explicitly declared test group will be executed.

### Log level

To set the log level of Strimzi for system tests need to add system property `TEST_STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL` with one of the following values: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`.
