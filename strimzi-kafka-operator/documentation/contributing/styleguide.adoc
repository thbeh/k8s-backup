.Additional General Guidelines
* Stick to one file per chapter unless the content is too long,
  excluding reusable topics.
* Don't use contractions, ;).
* Document IDs are book-scoped, so they don't need the book title in
  them.
* Terminate bulleted and numbered lists with periods unless the items
  listed are simple names.
* The words "server" and "broker" are not capitalized unless they
   begin a sentence or appear in a title.
* Avoid the word "simply" unless it clarifies.
* For substitution of `{attr}` in code blocks, use `[subs=+attributes]`.
* For styling of `++*bold*++` (`*bold*`) in code blocks, use
  `[subs=+quotes]`.
* Do not use the word 'the' before 'Broker'. It is just 'Broker'

[[ids]]
=== Section IDs

The format defined here is recommended because it is the most stable and versatile of anchor formats, and supports variables that enable topics to be reused and cross-referenced properly. Other anchor formats include `+++[[anchor-name]]+++` and `+++[#anchor-name]+++`, but these formats either do not support variables for content reuse or do not support certain character types, such as periods. These limitations cause errors at build time.

.IDs quick reference
[cols="33%,33%a,33%a",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Use |Not
.3+|Document IDs .3+|++[id="same-as-section-heading-{context}"]++
|\[[this-heading-here]]
|\[[ThisHeadingHere]]
|++[#anchor-name]++
|===

[[replaceables]]
=== Styling replaceables

Replaceable values in the text and code should be styles using monospace, lowercase, arrow brackets, and hyphens.

.Replaceables quick reference
[cols="50%,50%a",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Use
|Replaceable value |\`<some-value>`
|Location of broker instance |\`<broker-instance-dir>`
|Component install directory |\`<install-dir>`
|===

TIP: If using a replaceable within a source block, you will need to add
`subs="+quotes"`` to the source tag for it to render. (For example : `++[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]++`).

=== Styling Links

.Links Quick Reference
[cols="33%,33%a,33%a",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Use |Not
.2+|Zip files .2+|zip
|_.zip_
|ZIP
.2+|Tar files .2+|tar
|_.tar_
|TAR
|External links |\link:github.com[GitHub^] |\link:github.com[GitHub]
|Internal links |\xref:doc_id[Section Title]|\xref:doc_id[Section Title^]
|===

NOTE: If you use the caret syntax more than once in a single paragraph, you may need to
escape the first occurrence with a backslash.

IMPORTANT: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links)
are a feature unique to Asciidoctor. When they are enabled, you must surround the link text
in double quotes if it contains a comma.

.Additional Link Guidelines
* Refer to the top-level sections of books as chapters, not sections
  or topics.
* Do not split link paths across lines when wrapping text. This will cause issues with the doc builds.
